## About Me

I am a computer engineering student focused on building clean, modular and scalable systems.  
I enjoy working on algorithmic problems, system architecture, and software design.

Currently exploring:
- Graph algorithms & pathfinding
- Software architecture design
- Performance optimization
- Modular Python systems

## Featured Projects

### 🔹 NextWay (In Progress)
A modular pathfinding engine built in Python.  
Designed with scalability in mind to evolve toward real-world routing systems.

Focus:
- Graph abstraction
- Algorithm interchangeability (A*, Dijkstra, etc.)
- Clean architecture
- Future OpenStreetMap integration

---

### 🔹 Game Development Projects
Small experimental games (Snake, Flappy Bird clone)  
Built to explore:
- Object-oriented design
- Game loops
- Event handling
- Performance structure

---

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Git & GitHub
- Basic Web (HTML/CSS)
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Modular software design

---

## Engineering Philosophy

I believe in:
- Writing code that scales
- Separating concerns properly
- Designing before implementing
- Building projects that evolve over time
